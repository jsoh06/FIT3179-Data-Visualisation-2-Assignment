        <h1>LRT and Train Lines in Malaysia</h1>
        <p>Malaysia's rail transport network in the Klang Valley has developed 
          significantly since the 1990s to address growing urban congestion. The 
          Light Rail Transit (LRT) system forms the core of public transportation, 
          with two main lines serving different corridors. The LRT Kelana Jaya 
          Line runs from Gombak in the north to Putra Heights in the south, 
          while the LRT Ampang Line connects Sentul Timur to Ampang in the east.
           These lines intersect at several interchange stations, allowing 
           passengers to transfer between routes.</p>

        <p>This map displays the distribution of LRT stations across the Klang 
          Valley, showing how the two main lines serve different corridors of 
          the metropolitan area.</p>
        <div id="vis1" class="vis-container"></div>
        <p>The station distribution reveals the system's emphasis on serving 
          both the dense urban core around Kuala Lumpur and the sprawling 
          suburban developments that characterize the Klang Valley, with notable
           clusters of stations in major residential and commercial areas like 
           Petaling Jaya and Puchong.</p>

        <h2>Ridership Over Time</h2>
        <i style="font-size: 0.9em;">Ridership is the number of trips, 
          not the number of unique individuals/passengers.</i>
        <p>The LRT Kelana Jaya Line consistently maintains the highest ridership
           throughout the period, reaching over 240,000 daily passengers by 
           2024, while KTM Intercity remains the lowest with steady usage around
            15,000-20,000 passengers. Most lines show a clear recovery pattern 
            from mid-2021 onwards as restrictions eased and people returned to 
            work, though the recovery rates vary significantly between different
             rail services. This reveals how urban rail lines like LRT and 
             MRT were more severely affected by lockdowns compared to intercity 
             services, reflecting the different travel patterns and purposes of 
             their passenger bases.</p>
